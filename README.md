## Key-notes

It is both my first time working with NextJS and any DB related tooling.
I only later realized that NextJS is not the best suited framework for my deployment, since the speed of client side fetching made for far
better UX than any SSR could. If the DB was hosted on the same network as the NextJS server, this may have been different.
